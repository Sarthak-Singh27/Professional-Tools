                The linear guide ensures the precise processing effect, which can make delicate and complicated designs
                on acrylic, wood and PVC and so on for the advertisement and handicraft industries. Our three unique
                protection functions, i.e. anti-interference function, water-protective function and power cut off
                function ensure longer working life, safety and effectiveness. The machine adopts the strip shape
                platform, which can bear heavier materials such as organic glass, wood, and so on. Original Singapore
                lens with molybdenum base, making the equipment produce smaller facula and stronger cutting force,
                greatly improving working efficiency and reducing cost. Exhausting, absorbing and assistant blowing
                systems solve the problem that troubles the laser equipments manufacturing industry for years, extending
                the life of the laser tube. The best laser cutting system adopts USB port to transmit data, equipped
                with large-capacity internal memory mproving working speed and efficiency greatly. When the laser
                tube>=100W, advanced water chiller for cooling laser tube, adjust temperature automatically. Besides, it
                has the function that protect the laser tube from damaging caused by any incidents.Your can also
                choose CCD camera for the best laser cutting system to improve the working efficiency.
